Lovely. If you’re following along at home then you should be hearing the nice round tone of a sine wave. So, what about the other types of waves? Well, all we have to do is tell the oscillator what type of wave we want to use by specifying a number from 0-3.

oscillator.type = 1; // Tell the oscillator to use a square wave


oscillator.frequency.value = 900; // in hertz
